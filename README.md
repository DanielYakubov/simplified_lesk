# simplified_lesk
This repository stores a file that has a simple and readable implementation of the lesk algorithm. 
The implementation is strongly based on the pseudocode descriptoin outlined in chapter 18 of Jufarsky and Martin's 3rd edition text.
The main addition here is in functionality and the addition of some preprocessing. 
The script allows you to disambiguate entire corpora and have easier access to glosses.
